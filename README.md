# About
**Sakura** is an online store featuring products and deals directly from the factory outlet. With "Sakura Store" we intend to provide easy navigation and checkout options. With this project we also want to encourage visitors to explore the length and breadth of the products offered and to understand how these metrics add to the KPIs of the application and store as a whole. The gathered metrics will be checked for contribution in revenue generation.

# Prerequisite

The project requires:

* We strongly recommend the usage of Chrome browser for development purposes of this project. 
* Node.js LTS 14.16.1 for building. It can be downloaded and installed from here as per your operating system.
* For debugging Redux app, Redux Devtools should be installed. It helps you time-travel between app-state at different point of time. 
* For analysing react-dom rendering react-developer-tools can be installed. It helps you view the props passed down to the presentation components.
